Main copy of this project is hosted on GitHub:

Any member within the SystemArchAC may contribute to the "Edge IoT Architecture Design Guidelines" project. Contributions are licensed under [CC-BY-SA-4.0](LICENSE) and must be made with a Developer Certificate of Origin ([DCO](https://developercertificate.org/)) attestation as described below.  
It is recommended to run `make check` before sending patches.

"Edge IoT Architecture Design Guidelines" discussion uses Arm's SystemArchAC mailing list.

## DCO Attestation

To help track the origin of contributions, this project uses the same DCO "sign-off" process as used by the Linux kernel.  
The sign-off is a simple line at the end of the explanation for the patch, certifying that you wrote it or have the right to pass it on as an open-source patch.  

If you can certify the following:

### Developer's Certificate of Origin 1.1

By making a contribution to this project, I certify that:

1. The contribution was created in whole or in part by me, and I have the right to submit it under the open source license indicated in the file; or  
2. The contribution is based upon previous work that, to the best of my knowledge, is covered under an appropriate open source license, and I have the right under that license to submit that work with modifications, whether created in whole or in part by me, under the same open source license (unless I am permitted to submit under a different license), as indicated in the file; or  
3. The contribution was provided directly to me by another person who certified (a), (b), or (c), and I have not modified it.  
4. I understand and agree that this project and the contribution are public, and a record of the contribution (including all personal information I submit with it, including my sign-off) is maintained indefinitely and may be redistributed consistent with this project or the open source license(s) involved.

Then you just add a line saying:
