Secure Firmware on non-Secure firmware updates

Firmware Flash owned by Secure World
====================================

If the flash device is owned by the Secure World, the FMP managing the FW
images must communicate the FW images to the Firmware Update Implementation
[FWU]_.
The Firmware Update
Implementation in Secure World [FWU]_ writes the FW images to flash.
In this model the OS can install the
capsule by invoking the UEFI UpdateCapsule runtime service. The capsule can
be installed, by the UEFI Implementation, without requiring a system reboot.

The FWU metadata [FWU]_ is managed by the FWU Implementation in the Secure world.
The FWU metadata is described in Section 4.1 of [FWU]_.

When the flash is owned by the Secure World, the FMP communicates with the FWU Implementation
in the secure world using the [FFA]_ Firmware Update ABI [FWU]_

The FWU Implementation provides Non-secure firmware with a list of all FW images handled by it.  The information
is provided via the image directory [#FFANote]_.

.. [#FFANote] image directory is a stream of data structured as an array of image entries [FWU]_.

FMP interface for Secure World updates
---------------------------------------
The FMP is responsible for committing the FW images to flash and to provide the information used to
construct the ESRT table.

Each image entry in the FWU image directory exposes a set of fields which map directly to the
EFI_FIRMWARE_IMAGE_DESCRIPTOR as defined in the following table:

.. table:: EFI_FIRMWARE_IMAGE_DESCRIPTOR Implementation Requirements

   =============================== =============================
   FWU image directory entry field EFI_FIRMWARE_IMAGE_DESCRIPTOR
   =============================== =============================
   img_type_uuid                   ImageTypeId
   lowest_accepted_version         LowestSupportedImageVersion
   last_attempted_version          LastAttemptedVersion
   version                         Version
   image_max_size                  Size
   =============================== =============================

Firmware Flash owned by non-Secure World
========================================

If the flash device is owned by the Normal World, the FW images must be written to it directly by
the UEFI implementation.

Two models exist in this platform model:

- The OS places the capsule on the EFI system partition in the /efi/updatecapsule directory, as
  defined in ยง 8.5.5 - Delivery of Capsules via file on Mass Storage device [UEFI]_. After this
  the OS requests a platform reset.  The OS may optionally install an update application which
  installs the capsule at the next reboot.

- The OS calls the UEFI UpdateCapsule runtime service. The Capsule must have the
  CAPSULE_FLAGS_PERSIST_ACROSS_RESET bit set in the EFI_CAPSULE_HEADER flags field.
  The implementation must correctly flush all caches prior to performing the warm reset.

The FWU metadata [FWU]_ is managed by the UEFI implementation.
The FWU metadata is described in Section 4.1 of [FWU]_.

Example flows

#. OS receives a capsule with the new firmware
#. OS sets the acceptance request bit the Capsule header for all the images it wants to accept
#. OS passes the capsules to the UpdateCapsule runtime service
#. UEFI implementation traverses all the images in the capsule passing them to their corresponding FMPs
#. The FMP transfers the images to the FWU Implementation in the Secure World [FWU]_
#. OS requests a system reboot

Capsule install non-Secure World

  OS -> UEFI: Schedule CapsuleUpdate() on reboot
  OS -> UEFI ++: Call ResetSystem()

  deactivate UEFI

  UEFI -> FWU: Perform FW update

  UEFI -> TFA: PSCI_SYSTEM_RESET

#. OS receives a capsule with the new firmware
#. OS sets the acceptance request bit the Capsule header for all the images it wants to accept
#. OS schedules a CapsuleUpdate on disk and reboots
#. UEFI implementation traverses all the images in the capsule passing them to their corresponding FMPs
#. The UEFI firmware performs the update
#. UEFI firmware requests a system reboot

Post-capsule install -- Reboot success
--------------------------------------

.. note:: When the Normal world controls flash, FWU and UEFI are within the same \
   execution context.  In this case, the activations and returns between FWU and \
   UEFI are internal to the UEFI implementation.

#. Platform boots with the new FW
#. From the TFA boot report [FWU]_, UEFI verifies that platform booted from the intended bank
#. UEFI accepts a sub-set of the FW images [FWU]_ (the sub-set is platform specific)
#. OS loader obtains the ESRT from UEFI
#. OS boots
#. OS inspects the information in the ESRT
#. OS performs an image acceptance test for any un-accepted image
#. If all image tests pass correctly the OS exits the FW update procedure
#. OS install the image acceptance capsule when all acceptance tests pass
#. Firmware processes the image acceptance capsule and updates the boot bank
#. Rollback counter updates
    * If the Non-secure firmware can update the rollback counter(s) directly, it should do it on the fly
    * Otherwise, on the next reboot Secure firmware must detect the new version
      (rollback counter < fw rollback counter)and update the rollback counter(s) accordingly.
