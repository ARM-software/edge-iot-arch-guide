# UEFI spec


## UEFI Version

This document uses version 2.9 of the UEFI specification [UEFI]_.


## UEFI Compliance

All [UEFI]_ features required by [EBBR]_ are assumed.


## UEFI Extra Dependencies

The capsules installed using the procedure defined in this document must be formatted according to the FMP defined format [UEFI]_ ยง 23.1 - Firmware Management Protocol.  
The FMP instance must provide the `GetImageInfo` and `SetImage` functions to be used as the UpdateCapsule backend.

### ESRT

[UEFI]_ defines the System Resource Table (ESRT) ยง 23.4 - EFI System Resource Table.

Each entry in the ESRT describes a device or system firmware resource that can be targeted by a firmware capsule update.  
Each entry in the ESRT is also used to report the status of the last attempted update.

The UEFI specification defines a mapping between the ESRT fields and the `EFI_FIRMWARE_IMAGE_DESCRIPTOR` provided by `FMP.GetImageInfo()`.

- The resource entry field `FwClass` must be set to "ESRT_FW_TYPE_SYSTEMFIRMWARE."
- The fields `LowestSupportedVersion` and `FwVersion` are provided by:
  - The Secure World FWU when the Secure World is responsible for the update.
  - Non-secure firmware if the Non-Secure World is responsible for the update.

`LastAttemptStatus` is expected to be maintained by the UEFI implementation, relying partially on information provided by early platform boot stages [FWU]_.

The acceptance status of each FW image is provisionally displayed in the `LastAttemptedStatus` field [[1]](#provisional) in the ESRT image entry.  
A value of `0x3fff` implies that the image has not been accepted. The OS must explicitly accept the image by installing an acceptance capsule as described in `OS directed FW image acceptance`_.

[provisional]: https://gitlab.com/Linaro/trustedsubstrate/mbfw/-/blob/master/source/chapter2-uefi.rst?ref_type=heads&plain=0#id7
>[[1]](#provisional) Presenting the image acceptance status in the LastAttemptedStatus field is a provisional arrangement. A more permanet solution is under discussion.


## OS Requested FW Revert

The UEFI implementation informs the OS of the current FW images via the ESRT.

The OS can request a FW downgrade by installing the following signed capsule:

- `CapsuleGuid` = `acd58b4b-c0e8-475f-99b5-6b3f7e07aaf0`
- `HeaderSize` = `sizeof(EFI_CAPSULE_HEADER)`
- `Flags` = `0`
- `CapsuleImageSize` = `sizeof(EFI_CAPSULE_HEADER)`

**Note:** The image acceptance capsule must be authenticated. Details TBD.

When UEFI receives this capsule, it will:

1. Call the FWU primitive `fwu_set_active` [FWU]_ if the flash store is owned by the Secure World.
2. Set the `active_index` field in the FWU Metadata [FWU]_ if the flash store is owned by the Normal World.
3. Restore EFI variables to their previous state, if changed during the firmware upgrade.


## OS Directed FW Image Acceptance

### OS Declaration of Future Capsule Acceptance Responsibility

The OS can inform the UEFI implementation of all the FW images that it intends to explicitly accept.  
The OS sets the `EFI_CAPSULE_HEADER.Flags[15]` to `1` to indicate it will explicitly accept all the FW images in the capsule.  
The OS must accept all registered images. Other images may be implicitly accepted by the UEFI implementation.

### FW Image Acceptance

The OS accepts each image with pending acceptance using a capsule composed of an `EFI_CAPSULE_HEADER` concatenated with the image type UUID.  
**Note:** Performing a capsule update while in the trial state is prohibited.

- `CapsuleGuid` = `0c996046-bcc0-4d04-85ec-e1fcedf1c6f8`
- `HeaderSize` = `sizeof(EFI_CAPSULE_HEADER)`
- `Flags` = `0`
- `CapsuleImageSize` = `sizeof(EFI_CAPSULE_HEADER) + sizeof(UUID)`

**Note:** The image acceptance capsule must be authenticated. Details TBD.


## Update Permission Verification

The FW management guidelines in [NIST_800_193]_ specify:

1. Verification of FW image authenticity.
2. Authorization of the FW update procedure.

- FW image authenticity is implemented by authenticating FW images.
- FW update authorization ensures that the capsule or components were assembled by the platform owner.

### FW Update Authorization

FW update authorization [NIST_800_193]_ may be checked by the OS before calling `UpdateCapsule`.  
Alternatively, it can rely on FW image authenticity checks. If all images in the capsule are authentic, the user is authorized to proceed.

### FW Image Authentication

Each FW image should be signed by the FW vendor. The FW vendor signature should be placed before the image as described in the UEFI FMP definition (ยง 23.1 [UEFI]_).  
FW images must be authenticated before being written to the store or executed.


## Maximum Trial Platform Boots

The UEFI implementation must count consecutive platform boots in the Trial state [FWU]_. If the number exceeds `max_trial_boots`, the UEFI implementation must revert to the previous working bank [FWU]_.

**Note:** Similar functionality must be implemented in the first-stage bootloader. This is platform-specific but must count reboots and revert to a previous working version if the threshold is exceeded.
